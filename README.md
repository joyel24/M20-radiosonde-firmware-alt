# M20-radiosonde-firmware-alt
Alternative firmware for new models of radiosondes : Meteomodem M20 (including STM32L051R6T6 ADF7012 XM1110)

Made with STM32CubeIDE

Currently working on, some issues related to delays & timers while my frame is tx I think. Not usable for transmitting data from the radio module yet.

More updates in a couple of weeks because I'm a bit busy actually :
